# CodSoft-5
This is my fifth task with CodSoft Internships
The aim of the task is to build a python program for contacts book.
With this program we can add contacts having details like name,phone number,email, and address.
And we can view all contacts list at a time.
And even we can also able to update an existing contact.
And we can delete a contact which we won't need in our future.
And one more thing is we can even search an existing contact to see details of that contact.
